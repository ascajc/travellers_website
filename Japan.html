        <h1>Kyoto (Japan)</h1>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">About</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left">Kyoto, officially Kyoto City, is the capital city of Kyoto Prefecture in the Kansai
            region of Japan's
            largest and most populous island of Honshu. The city is the cultural anchor of the substantially larger
            Greater Kyoto,
            a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) home to a census-estimated 3.8 million people.
            It is also part of the even larger Keihanshin metropolitan area, along with Osaka and Kobe. </p>
        <br>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">Climate</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left">The climate of Kyoto, the ancient Japanese capital, located in the southern part of
            Honshu Island,
            is temperate humid, with quite mild winters and hot, moist, and rainy summers.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">In winter, there are fairly mild periods, with highs above 10 °C,
            alternating with cold periods, with wind and rain, highs around 5/7 °C or less, and possible falls of sleet
            or snow.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Summers in Kyoto are particularly hot and humid,
            both because of the distance from the sea and because of the heat island effect which is typical of big
            cities.
            There can be periods of good weather, with maximum temperatures around 35 °C or above, tropical nights and
            high humidity,
            but also periods of bad weather due to the summer monsoon.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Rainfall is quite abundant. The amount of sunshine in Kyoto, all things considered,
            is decent in winter.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">As regards to the climate, the best times to visit Kyoto are
            from mid-April to mid-May and from late October to mid-November. The cherry blossoming in Kyoto occurs
            around April the 3rd.</p>
        <br>

        <br>
