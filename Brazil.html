        <h1>Rio de janeiro (Brazil)</h1>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">About</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left">Rio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the Southern Hemisphere and is
            known for its natural settings,
            carnival, samba, bossa nova, and balneario beaches such as Barra da Tijuca, Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon.
            In addition to the beaches,
            landmarks include the giant statue of Christ the Redeemer atop Corcovado mountain, named one of the New
            Seven Wonders of the World;
            Sugarloaf Mountain with its cable car; the Sambódromo (Sambadrome), a permanent grandstand-lined parade
            avenue which is used during Carnival;
            and Maracanã Stadium, one of the world's largest football stadiums.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">Climate</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left">In Rio de Janeiro, the climate is tropical, with a relatively cool season from May to
            October and a hot,
            muggy and rainy season from December to March, with November and April as intermediate months.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Although the average temperatures are not very high, and thankfully the breeze
            usually blows, relieving the heat,
            during the warm season, very hot days can sometimes occur, with highs around 35/37 °C, from October to
            April. However, summery days can occur even in winter,
            with highs around 30/32 °C also in June, July and August.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">On the other hand, during the cool season, from May to October, cold air masses of
            Antarctic origin can bring cool temperatures,
            or even a little cold at night, in fact, lows can drop to around 10/12 °C, and highs can stay around 18/20
            °C.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Rainfall is more abundant in summer, from December to March, when the rains mainly
            occur in the form of showers or thunderstorms.
            Sometimes the rains can be particularly intense and cause floods. Winter is quite dry, but at times, some
            disturbances can affect this area,
            bringing some days of bad weather, and also cool temperatures. This happens mostly in mid-winter (in the
            months of June, July and August),
            but it can also occur in the months of May, September and October.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">The best time to visit Rio de Janeiro is winter, from May to October: temperatures
            are generally pleasant, with quite rare rains.
            It will be possible to spend a relaxing time on the beaches, to sunbathe, and to try to swim in a sea a
            little cool.
            A sweatshirt and a light jacket can help for the evening and on cool and cloudy days.</p>
