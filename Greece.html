        <h1>Santorini Island (Greece)</h1>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">About</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left">Santorini is a volcanic island in the southern Aegean Sea, southeast of mainland
            Greece.
            It is the largest island of a small, circular archipelago formed by the Santorini caldera.
            It has an area of approximately 28 square miles and a 2021 census population of 15,480.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">Climate</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left">The climate of Santorini is Mediterranean with mild, rainy winters and warm, sunny
            summers.
            In the warm season, starting from May, the Cyclades (and therefore also Santorini) are particularly affected
            by the Meltemi,
            a wind that blows from the north, persistently and in periods lasting a few days. This wind is able to make
            the air feel cooler than it is.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">In winter, from December to mid-March, temperatures are generally mild, but waves of
            bad weather, with wind and rain, can not be excluded.
            Given its southern location, snow in Santorini is rarer than in the other Cyclades islands.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">In spring, from mid-March to May, the weather is mild, and it gradually becomes more
            stable, with rain becoming gradually less frequent.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Summer, from June to mid-September, is warm and sunny. The wind makes the heat almost
            always bearable.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Autumn, from mid-September to November, is initially warm and sunny, but then, the
            first rains occur, and with each passing week,
            they become more frequent. In autumn, there may be many sunny days, but the rains in this season can
            sometimes be abundant.</p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">Budget</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left">For the average person a trip to santorini costs around $3,681 (€3,500) for a one
            week trip for two people.
