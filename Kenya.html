        <h1>Kenya</h1>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">About</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left">Kenya's geography, climate and population vary widely, ranging from cold snow-capped
            mountaintops
            with vast surrounding forests, wildlife and fertile agricultural regions to temperate climates in western
            and rift valley
            counties and further on to dry less fertile arid and semi-arid areas and absolute deserts.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">Climate</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left">Kenya is an African country, bisected by the Equator, yet it has three types of
            climate:
            hot and humid along the coast facing the indian ocean, temperate in the west and south-west, and finally,
            hot and dry in the north and east.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">On the coast of Kenya, the best months for a beach holiday are August and September,
            since they are the coolest, and are also quite sunny and with rare rains. If you want, you can also choose
            January and February,
            which are the driest months of the year, but they are also hot and muggy.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">If you want to visit the arid regions, July and August are the least hot months,
            although there is no big difference in comparison with the rest of the year: the heat is still intense.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">For a safari in national parks and in the highlands, you can choose from two periods:
            June to September and January-February. In the former period, the risk of showers in the afternoon and
            evening
            is higher at high altitudes, in the latter, the chance of intense heat at lower altitudes.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">Facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li style="text-align:left">Both English and Swahili are spoken interchangeably</li>
            <li style="text-align:left">The currency used is the Kenya Shilling</li>
            <li style="text-align:left">Power outlets are type G</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">Budget</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left">A one week trip to Kenya for two people costs, on average,
            $1,963 (KES253,344). This includes accommodation, food, local transportation, and sightseeing.</p>
