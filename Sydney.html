        <h1>Sydney</h1>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">About</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left">Sydney is the capital city of the state of New South Wales and the most populous city
            in Australia.
            Located on Australia's east coast, the metropolis surrounds Sydney Harbour and extends about 80 km from the
            Pacific Ocean in the east to the
            Blue Mountains in the west. Greater Sydney consists of 658 suburbs, spread across 33 local government areas.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">Climate</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left">The climate of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales, lying on the southeast coast
            of Australia, at 34 degrees south latitude,
            is humid subtropical, with mild winters and warm summers.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">The wind blows frequently, especially from October to April, that is, in the warm
            season.
            The amount of sunshine is good enough throughout the year. From October to March, heatwaves may occur, with
            the wind blowing from the desert,
            which can raise the temperature above 35 °C, though for short periods, sometimes only one day, in addition,
            the wind can bring sand and dust from the desert.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Rainfall is fairly abundant, since it is close to 1,000 millimeters per year. There
            is no dry season, however,
            the driest season is spring. The wettest months are February and June. Although the climate of Sydney is
            generally good, sometimes,
            there may be particularly intense rains, thunderstorms and hailstorms.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Winter, from June to August, is mild, with an average daily temperature of 13/14 °C,
            but it is also a rainy season,
            especially in the first part. In addition, houses generally do not have heating and are poorly insulated, so
            the feeling of cold is greater than one might expect.
            Spring, from September to November, is mild or pleasantly warm, sunny enough, and generally not too rainy.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Summer, from December to March, is warm, with average temperatures not too high, and
            generally pleasant.
            Sea breezes constantly blow in the afternoon, and can sometimes be intense. Autumn, in April and May, is
            very mild, but it is also a rainy season.
            During some years, the rains can be plentiful.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">The best season to go to Sydney is spring, in September and October, since it is
            mild, quite dry and sunny.</p>
        <br>
